## Purpose
* The purpose for this week is to challenge ourselves in creating a daily planner with features that is usable for the user. We will create a planner that has the current date and have time frame sections where the user can enter and save their daily task.

## Goals for this Work Day Planner
* As soons as the user opens up the planner, the current day and date will be displayed at the top of the application.
* When the user scrolls down the page, the user is presented with time blocks that represents standard business hours.
* Each time block is color coded to indicate to tell the user if the time is in the "past", "present", or "future".
* We want the user to be able to interact with the time block and be able to enter anything that the user wants.
* When the user uses the save button, their text will be saved in localStorage.
